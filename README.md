# Brunhilde

Endless Runner 2D

Hello, this is my first unity's project, the game is inspired to my cat Brunhilde she runs a lot during her dreams, the goal of the gameplay is to let Brunhilde sleep so put your iphone in horizontal, avoid the obstacle and don't disturb the cat's sleep. As promise 1.0(1) is now available, the background issue is solved and now there are also some new item then later will be power ups. Leave a lot of feedback and share any ideas. This is the second build, update will come soon.
